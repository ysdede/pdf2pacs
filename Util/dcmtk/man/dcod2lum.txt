NAME
       dcod2lum  -  Convert  hardcopy  characteristic  curve  file to softcopy
       format

SYNOPSIS
       dcod2lum in-file out-file


DESCRIPTION
       Command line program that converts a hardcopy characteristic curve file
       to  softcopy  format. In other words, the measured optical density (OD)
       values from the input file  are  transformed  to  the  luminance  space
       according to the formula:



         L = La + L0 * 10^(-D)


       where  L  is the resulting luminance, La is the reflected ambient light
       and L0 the illumination (both measured  in  cd/m^2),  ’D’  the  optical
       density (OD). Please note that if no illumination value is specified in
       the input file (keyword lum) all optical density values are mapped to a
       constant luminance.

PARAMETERS
       in-file   hardcopy characteristic curve file to be converted

       out-file  softcopy characteristic curve file to be written


NOTES
       The  format of both input and ouput file is described the documentation
       of the dcmdspfn  command  line  tool.  In  addition,  the  data  folder
       contains  sample  characteristics  file monitors, cameras, printers and
       scanners.

FILES
       <datadir>/camera.lut - sample characteristics file of a camera
       <datadir>/monitor.lut - sample characteristics file of a monitor
       <datadir>/printer.lut - sample characteristics file of a printer
       <datadir>/scanner.lut - sample characteristics file of a scanner
