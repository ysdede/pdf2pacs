NAME
       findscu - DICOM query (C-FIND) SCU

SYNOPSIS
       findscu [options] peer port [dcmfile-in...]


DESCRIPTION
       The  findscu  application  implements  an  SCU  for  the Query/Retrieve
       Service Class and the Basic Worklist Management Service Class.  findscu
       only  supports  query  functionality using the C-FIND message. It sends
       query keys to an SCP and awaits responses. The application can be  used
       to  test  SCPs  of  the  Query/Retrieve  and  Basic Worklist Management
       Service Classes.

PARAMETERS
       peer        hostname of DICOM peer

       port        tcp/ip port number of peer

       dcmfile-in  DICOM query file(s)

NOTES
       Each file supplied on the command line will be sent to the SCP as  part
       of  a  C-FIND  request.  The  query file must be a valid DICOM data set
       containing the dataset part of a  C-FIND-RQ  message.  The  query  file
       could, for instance, be created with the dump2dcm utility from a script
       like the following example:



       # query patient names and IDs
       (0008,0052) CS [PATIENT]     # QueryRetrieveLevel
       (0010,0010) PN []            # PatientName
       (0010,0020) LO []            # PatientID


       Individual attributes of each file sent can be modified or supplemented
       using the -k option. For example the command:



       findscu -P -k "(0010,0010)=HEWETT*" caesar 5678 patqry.dcm


       will,  when  sent  to  the  SCP  caesar  at TCP/IP port 5678, cause any
       PatientName attribute in patqry.dcm to have  the  value  ’HEWETT*’.  If
       such  an attribute is present it will be replaced, if absent it will be
       inserted. The -k option can be present more than once. The  value  part
       (after  the  ’=’)  may  be absent causing the attribute to be sent with
       zero length.

       In earlier versions of findscu, the tag  keys  were  specified  without
       braces  around  group  and element number, e. g. ’0010,0010’ instead of
       ’(0010,0010)’. It is recommended switching to the new syntax;  however,
       the old syntax is still working.

       Also -k accepts dictionary names instead of element tags for specifying
       DICOM elements. For example, the findscu call  above  then  reads  like
       this:



       findscu -P -k PatientName="HEWETT*" caesar 5678 patqry.dcm


       It  is  also possible to specify sequences, items and nested attributes
       using the -k option. In these cases, a special ’path’ notation  has  to
       be used, e. g.



       findscu -W -k "(0040,0100)[0].Modality=CT" caesar 5678


       This  call  queries  a  worklist  server at host caesar for any planned
       procedures for CT modalities by specifing  tag  (0040,0100)  ’Scheduled
       Procedure  Step Sequence’ and an attribute ’Modality’ in the first item
       of this sequence with value ’CT’. Details on this path notation can  be
       found in the documentation of dcmodify.

       If  no  file  is  specified  on  the  command  line,  the query must be
       specified completely with one or more -k options.

       Each set of response identifiers received will  be  printed  to  stdout
       unless option --extract is used.

   DICOM Conformance
       The findscu application supports the following SOP Classes as an SCU:



       FINDPatientRootQueryRetrieveInformationModel       1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.1.1
       FINDStudyRootQueryRetrieveInformationModel         1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.2.1
       FINDPatientStudyOnlyQueryRetrieveInformationModel  1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.2.3.1
       FINDModalityWorklistInformationModel               1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.31


       The  findscu  application will propose presentation contexts for one of
       the abovementioned supported SOP  Classes  depending  on  command  line
       options  (-P,  -S,  -O  or -W). Each proposed presentation context will
       propose the transfer syntaxes:



       LittleEndianImplicitTransferSyntax                 1.2.840.10008.1.2
       LittleEndianExplicitTransferSyntax                 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1
       BigEndianExplicitTransferSyntax                    1.2.840.10008.1.2.2


       The findscu application does not support extended negotiation.

LOGGING
       The level of logging output of  the  various  command  line  tools  and
       underlying  libraries  can  be  specified by the user. By default, only
       errors and warnings are written to the  standard  error  stream.  Using
       option  --verbose  also  informational messages like processing details
       are reported. Option --debug can be used to get  more  details  on  the
       internal  activity,  e.g.  for debugging purposes. Other logging levels
       can be selected using option --log-level. In --quiet  mode  only  fatal
       errors  are reported. In such very severe error events, the application
       will usually terminate. For  more  details  on  the  different  logging
       levels, see documentation of module ’oflog’.

       In  case  the logging output should be written to file (optionally with
       logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the event log  (Windows)  option
       --log-config  can  be  used.  This  configuration  file also allows for
       directing only certain messages to a particular output stream  and  for
       filtering  certain  messages  based  on the module or application where
       they are generated.  An  example  configuration  file  is  provided  in
       <etcdir>/logger.cfg).

COMMAND LINE
       All  command  line  tools  use  the  following notation for parameters:
       square brackets enclose optional  values  (0-1),  three  trailing  dots
       indicate  that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both
       means 0 to n values.

       Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading ’+’
       or  ’-’ sign, respectively. Usually, order and position of command line
       options are arbitrary (i.e. they  can  appear  anywhere).  However,  if
       options  are  mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This
       behaviour conforms to the standard  evaluation  rules  of  common  Unix
       shells.

       In  addition,  one  or more command files can be specified using an ’@’
       sign as a prefix to the filename (e.g. @command.txt).  Such  a  command
       argument  is  replaced  by  the  content of the corresponding text file
       (multiple whitespaces are treated as a  single  separator  unless  they
       appear  between  two  quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation.
       Please note that a command file cannot contain  another  command  file.
       This   simple   but  effective  approach  allows  to  summarize  common
       combinations of options/parameters and  avoids  longish  and  confusing
       command lines (an example is provided in file <datadir>/dumppat.txt).

ENVIRONMENT
       The  findscu  utility  will  attempt  to  load  DICOM data dictionaries
       specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable. By default, i.e.  if
       the   DCMDICTPATH   environment   variable   is   not   set,  the  file
       <datadir>/dicom.dic will be loaded unless the dictionary is built  into
       the application (default for Windows).

       The   default   behaviour  should  be  preferred  and  the  DCMDICTPATH
       environment variable only used when alternative data  dictionaries  are
       required.  The  DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same format as
       the Unix shell PATH variable in that a colon (’:’)  separates  entries.
       On  Windows systems, a semicolon (’;’) is used as a separator. The data
       dictionary code will  attempt  to  load  each  file  specified  in  the
       DCMDICTPATH  environment variable. It is an error if no data dictionary
       can be loaded.
