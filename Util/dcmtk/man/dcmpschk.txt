NAME
       dcmpschk - Checking tool for presentation states

SYNOPSIS
       dcmpschk [options] [dcmfile-in...]


DESCRIPTION
       The dcmpschk utility checks DICOM Grayscale Softcopy Presentation State
       objects for conformance with the standard. The  test  is  performed  in
       three phases:

       · Phase  1  checks  the  Meta-header  of  the  DICOM file. It is tested
         whether all required attributes are present, whether  the  SOP  class
         and  instance  UIDs match the UIDs in the main object and whether the
         group length attribute contains a correct value. The Transfer  Syntax
         of the Meta header is also checked.
       · Phase   2   performs   a   syntactic   check  of  the  values,  value
         representations and value multiplicities for each  attribute  in  the
         object. The values present in the object under test are compared with
         the definitions of the DICOM data dictionary.
       · Phase  3  performs  a  semantic  check  of  the  integrity   of   the
         Presentation  State.  This phase is omitted when objects of other SOP
         Classes are encountered. Phase 1 and 2 can also be applied  to  other
         DICOM  objects  of  arbitrary  SOP  class.  It  should  be noted that
         dcmpschk does not support Presentation States which contain the  Mask
         Module. These will be rejected with a message that the Mask Module is
         not supported.

         -ll  --log-level  [l]evel: string constant
                (fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace)
                use level l for the logger

         -lc  --log-config  [f]ilename: string
                use config file f for the logger
LOGGING
       The level of logging output of  the  various  command  line  tools  and
       underlying  libraries  can  be  specified by the user. By default, only
       errors and warnings are written to the  standard  error  stream.  Using
       option  --verbose  also  informational messages like processing details
       are reported. Option --debug can be used to get  more  details  on  the
       internal  activity,  e.g.  for debugging purposes. Other logging levels
       can be selected using option --log-level. In --quiet  mode  only  fatal
       errors  are reported. In such very severe error events, the application
       will usually terminate. For  more  details  on  the  different  logging
       levels, see documentation of module ’oflog’.
       In  case  the logging output should be written to file (optionally with
       logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the event log  (Windows)  option
       --log-config  can  be  used.  This  configuration  file also allows for
       directing only certain messages to a particular output stream  and  for
       filtering  certain  messages  based  on the module or application where
       they are generated.  An  example  configuration  file  is  provided  in
       <etcdir>/logger.cfg).
COMMAND LINE
       All  command  line  tools  use  the  following notation for parameters:
       square brackets enclose optional  values  (0-1),  three  trailing  dots
       indicate  that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both
       means 0 to n values.
       Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading ’+’
       or  ’-’ sign, respectively. Usually, order and position of command line
       options are arbitrary (i.e. they  can  appear  anywhere).  However,  if
       options  are  mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This
       behaviour conforms to the standard  evaluation  rules  of  common  Unix
       shells.
       In  addition,  one  or more command files can be specified using an ’@’
       sign as a prefix to the filename (e.g. @command.txt).  Such  a  command
       argument  is  replaced  by  the  content of the corresponding text file
       (multiple whitespaces are treated as a  single  separator  unless  they
       appear  between  two  quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation.
       Please note that a command file cannot contain  another  command  file.
       This   simple   but  effective  approach  allows  to  summarize  common
       combinations of options/parameters and  avoids  longish  and  confusing
       command lines (an example is provided in file <datadir>/dumppat.txt).
ENVIRONMENT
       The  dcmpschk  utility  will  attempt  to  load DICOM data dictionaries
       specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable. By default, i.e.  if
       the   DCMDICTPATH   environment   variable   is   not   set,  the  file
       <datadir>/dicom.dic will be loaded unless the dictionary is built  into
       the application (default for Windows).
       The   default   behaviour  should  be  preferred  and  the  DCMDICTPATH
       environment variable only used when alternative data  dictionaries  are
       required.  The  DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same format as
       the Unix shell PATH variable in that a colon (’:’)  separates  entries.
       On  Windows systems, a semicolon (’;’) is used as a separator. The data
       dictionary code will  attempt  to  load  each  file  specified  in  the
       DCMDICTPATH  environment variable. It is an error if no data dictionary
       can be loaded.
