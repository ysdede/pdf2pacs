NAME
       dcmmkdir - Create a DICOMDIR file

SYNOPSIS
       dcmmkdir [options] [dcmfile-in...]

       referenced DICOM files according to the DICOM  Part  11  Media  Storage
       Application Profiles.

       This tool extends  dcmgpdir  which  can  only  create  General  Purpose
       DICOMDIR  files.  The  default  behaviour  of dcmmkdir (with --general-
       purpose) is equivalent to that of dcmgpdir.

NOTES
       All files specified on the command line (or  discovered  by  recursivly
       examining  the  contents  of  directories with the +r option) are first
       evaluated for their compatibility  with  the  specified  Media  Storage
       Application Profile (Part 11). Only appropriate files encoded using one
       of the allowed Transfer Syntaxes will be accepted. Files having invalid
       filenames  will  be  rejected  (the  rules  can  be  relaxed via the +m
       option). Files missing required attributes will  be  rejected  (the  +I
       option can relax this behaviour).
       A  DICOMDIR  file  will  only  be  constructed if all files have passed
       initial tests.
       The dcmmkdir utility also allows to append new entries to and to update
       existing  entries  in  a DICOMDIR file. Using option +A new entries are
       only appended to the DICOMDIR, i.e. existing records like the ones  for
       PATIENT  information  are  not  updated.  Using option +U also existing
       records  are  updated  according  to  the  information  found  in   the
       referenced  DICOM  files. Please note that this update process might be
       slower than just appending new entries. However,  it  makes  sure  that
       additional  information  that  is required for the selected application
       profile is also added to existing records.
       The support for icon  images  is  currently  restricted  to  monochrome
       images.  This  might  change in the future. Till then, color images are
       automatically converted to grayscale mode. The  icon  size  is  128*128
       pixels for the cardiac profiles (as required by the DICOM standard) and
       64*64 for all others.
LOGGING
       The level of logging output of  the  various  command  line  tools  and
       underlying  libraries  can  be  specified by the user. By default, only
       errors and warnings are written to the  standard  error  stream.  Using
       option  --verbose  also  informational messages like processing details
       are reported. Option --debug can be used to get  more  details  on  the
       internal  activity,  e.g.  for debugging purposes. Other logging levels
       can be selected using option --log-level. In --quiet  mode  only  fatal
       errors  are reported. In such very severe error events, the application
       will usually terminate. For  more  details  on  the  different  logging
       levels, see documentation of module ’oflog’.
       In  case  the logging output should be written to file (optionally with
       logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the event log  (Windows)  option
       --log-config  can  be  used.  This  configuration  file also allows for
       directing only certain messages to a particular output stream  and  for
       filtering  certain  messages  based  on the module or application where
       they are generated.  An  example  configuration  file  is  provided  in
       <etcdir>/logger.cfg).
COMMAND LINE
       All  command  line  tools  use  the  following notation for parameters:
       square brackets enclose optional  values  (0-1),  three  trailing  dots
       indicate  that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both
       means 0 to n values.
       Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading ’+’
       or  ’-’ sign, respectively. Usually, order and position of command line
       options are arbitrary (i.e. they  can  appear  anywhere).  However,  if
       options  are  mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This
       behaviour conforms to the standard  evaluation  rules  of  common  Unix
       shells.
       In  addition,  one  or more command files can be specified using an ’@’
       sign as a prefix to the filename (e.g. @command.txt).  Such  a  command
       argument  is  replaced  by  the  content of the corresponding text file
       (multiple whitespaces are treated as a  single  separator  unless  they
       appear  between  two  quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation.
       Please note that a command file cannot contain  another  command  file.
       This   simple   but  effective  approach  allows  to  summarize  common
       combinations of options/parameters and  avoids  longish  and  confusing
       command lines (an example is provided in file <datadir>/dumppat.txt).
ENVIRONMENT
       The  dcmmkdir  utility  will  attempt  to  load DICOM data dictionaries
       specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable. By default, i.e.  if
       the   DCMDICTPATH   environment   variable   is   not   set,  the  file
       <datadir>/dicom.dic will be loaded unless the dictionary is built  into
       the application (default for Windows).
       The   default   behaviour  should  be  preferred  and  the  DCMDICTPATH
       environment variable only used when alternative data  dictionaries  are
       required.  The  DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same format as
       the Unix shell PATH variable in that a colon (’:’)  separates  entries.
       On  Windows systems, a semicolon (’;’) is used as a separator. The data
       dictionary code will  attempt  to  load  each  file  specified  in  the
       DCMDICTPATH  environment variable. It is an error if no data dictionary
       can be loaded.
