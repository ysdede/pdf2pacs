NAME
       wlmscpfs - DICOM Basic Worklist Management SCP (based on data files)

SYNOPSIS
       wlmscpfs [options] port


DESCRIPTION
       The  wlmscpfs application implements a Service Class Provider (SCP) for
       the Basic Worklist Management Service. The application will listen on a
       specified TCP/IP port for incoming association requests from a Worklist
       Management SCU. In case an association was acknowledged and a  worklist
       query  was  received,  the  wlmscpfs  application will query particular
       files  in  a  certain  directory  (which  can  be   specified   through
       corresponding  program  options)  on  the file system for corresponding
       worklist information, and it will send this  information  back  to  the
       calling  Worklist  Management  SCU.  Aside  from  dealing with Worklist
       Management  queries,  the  wlmscpfs  application  also   supports   the
       Verification Service Class as an SCP.

NOTES
       The  semantic  impacts  of the above mentioned options is clear for the
       majority of options. Some particular options, however, are so  specific
       that  they  need  detailed  descriptions  which  will  be given in this
       passage.

       The returned character set options are intended for situations in which
       the  wlmscpfs  application  will  return attribute values which are not
       composed of characters from the DICOM default character repertoire.  In
       such  cases,  for  example  option  --return-iso-ir-100  can be used to
       specify that a response to  a  modality’s  worklist  management  C-FIND
       request   shall   contain  DICOM’s  Specific  Character  Set  attribute
       (0008,0005)  with  a  corresponding  value,  indicating  the  character
       repertoire  from which the characters of returned attribute values were
       taken (in this example the repertoire ISO IR 100). Please note that the
       wlmscpfs  application  will  not make sure that all returned values are
       actually made up of this character repertoire; the application  expects
       this to be the case.

       In  general, the Specific Character Set attribute (0008,0005) will only
       be included in the C-FIND response if it contains any  attributes  that
       are  affected  by the character set, i.e. for value representations PN,
       LO, LT, SH, ST and UT.

       Please note that a C-FIND request which is handled by this  application
       may  contain  DICOM’s Specific Character Set attribute (0008,0005), but
       this application will never use this attribute’s  value  for  matching.
       Besides,  the  question  if  DICOM’s  Specific  Character Set attribute
       (0008,0005) will be contained in a C-FIND response which is returned by
       this  application  is  always  determined by the returned character set
       option which was specified when this application was started.

       The options --enable-file-reject and --disable-file-reject can be  used
       to  enable  or disable a file rejection mechanism which makes sure only
       complete worklist files will be used during  the  matching  process.  A
       worklist file is considered to be complete if it contains all necessary
       type 1 information which the SCP might have to return to an SCU in a C-
       FIND  response  message.  Table  K.6-1  in  part 4 annex K of the DICOM
       standard lists all corresponding type 1 attributes (see column  ’Return
       Key Type’).

   DICOM Conformance
       The wlmscpfs application supports the following SOP Classes as an SCP:



       VerificationSOPClass                  1.2.840.10008.1.1
       FINDModalityWorklistInformationModel  1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.31


       The  wlmscpfs  application will accept presentation contexts for all of
       the abovementioned supported SOP Classes  using  any  of  the  transfer
       syntaxes:



       LittleEndianImplicitTransferSyntax    1.2.840.10008.1.2
       LittleEndianExplicitTransferSyntax    1.2.840.10008.1.2.1
       BigEndianExplicitTransferSyntax       1.2.840.10008.1.2.2


       The default behaviour of the wlmscpfs application is to prefer transfer
       syntaxes having an explicit encoding over the default implicit transfer
       syntax.  If  wlmscpfs  is running on big-endian hardware it will prefer
       BigEndianExplicit to LittleEndianExplicit  transfer  syntax  (and  vice
       versa).  This  behaviour  can be changed with the --prefer options (see
       above).

       The wlmscpfs application does not support extended negotiation.

       Currently, the wlmscpfs application supports the  following  attributes
       as matching keys:



       (0008,0050) AccessionNumber
       (0008,0090) ReferringPhysicianName
       (0010,0010) PatientName

       The attribute (0008,0005) SpecificCharacterSet is a  special  case  and
       its support by wlmscpfs is discussed in the NOTES section above.

   Access Control
       When  compiled  on  Unix platforms with TCP wrapper support, host-based
       access control can be enabled with the  --access-control  command  line
       option.  In  this case the access control rules defined in the system’s
       host access control tables  for  wlmscpfs  are  enforced.  The  default
       locations  of  the  host access control tables are /etc/hosts.allow and
       /etc/hosts.deny. Further details are described in hosts_access(5).

LOGGING
       The level of logging output of  the  various  command  line  tools  and
       underlying  libraries  can  be  specified by the user. By default, only
       errors and warnings are written to the  standard  error  stream.  Using
       option  --verbose  also  informational messages like processing details
       are reported. Option --debug can be used to get  more  details  on  the
       internal  activity,  e.g.  for debugging purposes. Other logging levels
       can be selected using option --log-level. In --quiet  mode  only  fatal
       errors  are reported. In such very severe error events, the application
       will usually terminate. For  more  details  on  the  different  logging
       levels, see documentation of module ’oflog’.

       In  case  the logging output should be written to file (optionally with
       logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the event log  (Windows)  option
       --log-config  can  be  used.  This  configuration  file also allows for
       directing only certain messages to a particular output stream  and  for
       filtering  certain  messages  based  on the module or application where
       they are generated.  An  example  configuration  file  is  provided  in
       <etcdir>/logger.cfg).

COMMAND LINE
       All  command  line  tools  use  the  following notation for parameters:
       square brackets enclose optional  values  (0-1),  three  trailing  dots
       indicate  that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both
       means 0 to n values.

       Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading ’+’
       or  ’-’ sign, respectively. Usually, order and position of command line
       options are arbitrary (i.e. they  can  appear  anywhere).  However,  if
       options  are  mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This
       behaviour conforms to the standard  evaluation  rules  of  common  Unix
       shells.

       In  addition,  one  or more command files can be specified using an ’@’
       sign as a prefix to the filename (e.g. @command.txt).  Such  a  command
       argument  is  replaced  by  the  content of the corresponding text file
       (multiple whitespaces are treated as a  single  separator  unless  they
       appear  between  two  quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation.
       Please note that a command file cannot contain  another  command  file.
       This   simple   but  effective  approach  allows  to  summarize  common
       combinations of options/parameters and  avoids  longish  and  confusing
       command lines (an example is provided in file <datadir>/dumppat.txt).

ENVIRONMENT
       The  wlmscpfs  utility  will  attempt  to  load DICOM data dictionaries
       specified in the DCMDICTPATH environment variable. By default, i.e.  if
       the   DCMDICTPATH   environment   variable   is   not   set,  the  file
       <datadir>/dicom.dic will be loaded unless the dictionary is built  into
       the application (default for Windows).

       The   default   behaviour  should  be  preferred  and  the  DCMDICTPATH
       environment variable only used when alternative data  dictionaries  are
       required.  The  DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same format as
       the Unix shell PATH variable in that a colon (’:’)  separates  entries.
       On  Windows systems, a semicolon (’;’) is used as a separator. The data
       dictionary code will  attempt  to  load  each  file  specified  in  the
       DCMDICTPATH  environment variable. It is an error if no data dictionary
       can be loaded.
